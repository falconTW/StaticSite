## What is SOLID principle ?

SOLID stands for five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. 
The intention is that these principles, when applied together, will make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time.The principles of SOLID are guidelines that can be applied while working on software to remove code smells by providing a framework through which the programmer may refactor the software's source code until it is both legible and extensible.
